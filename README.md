# Microsoft: Classifying Cybersecurity Incidents with Machine Learning

## Project Overview
Develop a machine learning model to classify cybersecurity incidents as True Positive (TP), Benign Positive (BP), or False Positive (FP) using the GUIDE dataset to enhance SOC efficiency.

## Key Skills
- Data Preprocessing & Feature Engineering
- ML Classification Techniques
- Model Evaluation Metrics
- Handling Imbalanced Data
- Cybersecurity Frameworks (MITRE ATT&CK)

## Dataset
Three hierarchical levels:
1. **Evidence**: IPs, emails, user details
2. **Alert**: Aggregated evidence
3. **Incident**: Security breach scenarios

1M incidents with 45 features, split into 70% train and 30% test sets.

## Approach
1. **EDA**: Analyze data structure and distributions
2. **Preprocessing**: Handle missing values, feature engineering
3. **Modeling**: Baseline models â†’ Advanced models (XGBoost, etc.)
4. **Evaluation**: Macro-F1, Precision, Recall metrics
