# Microsoft: Classifying Cybersecurity Incidents with Machine Learning

## Project Overview

This project focuses on developing a robust machine learning model to enhance the efficiency of Security Operation Centers (SOCs) by accurately predicting the triage grade of cybersecurity incidents. As a data scientist at Microsoft, you'll leverage the comprehensive GUIDE dataset to classify incidents as **true positive (TP)**, **benign positive (BP)**, or **false positive (FP)** based on historical evidence and customer responses. The ultimate goal is to support guided response systems, providing SOC analysts with precise, context-rich recommendations, and improving the overall security posture of enterprise environments.

The model will be trained using the `train.csv` dataset, and its performance will be evaluated on the `test.csv` dataset using key metrics: **Macro-F1 score, Precision, and Recall**. This ensures the model's reliability for real-world applications and its ability to generalize effectively to unseen data.

## Data Set Overview

The GUIDE dataset provides a hierarchical view of cybersecurity data, organized into:

1.  **Evidence:** The lowest level, supporting an alert with specific metadata (e.g., IP address, email, user details).
2.  **Alert:** Consolidates multiple pieces of evidence, providing broader context for a potential security incident.
3.  **Incident:** The highest level, encompassing one or more alerts and representing a cohesive narrative of a security breach or threat scenario.

The dataset's primary objective is to predict incident triage grades (**TP, BP, FP**) based on historical customer responses. It includes a training dataset with 45 features, labels, and unique identifiers across 1 million triage-annotated incidents. The dataset is divided into a **70% train set** and a **30% test set**, stratified by triage grade ground-truth, `OrgId`, and `DetectorId` to ensure the relevance of evidence and alert rows within each split.

### Data Set Explanation

The `GUIDE` dataset comprises records of cybersecurity incidents, each with a corresponding triage grade (TP, BP, FP) derived from historical evidence and customer responses. Key preprocessing steps you'll likely undertake include:

* **Handling Missing Data:** Identifying and addressing any missing values.
* **Feature Engineering:** Creating new or modifying existing features to improve model performance (e.g., deriving features from timestamps, combining related features).
* **Normalization/Standardization:** Scaling numerical features to ensure consistent input data ranges, crucial for certain machine learning algorithms.

## Approach

This project will follow a structured machine learning workflow to build and evaluate the classification model:

### 1. Data Exploration and Understanding

* **Initial Inspection:** Load `train.csv`, understand its structure (features, variable types), and analyze the distribution of the target variable (TP, BP, FP).
* **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Use visualizations and statistical summaries to identify patterns, correlations, and anomalies. Pay close attention to class imbalances.

### 2. Data Preprocessing

* **Handling Missing Data:** Implement strategies for missing values (imputation, removal, or using robust models).
* **Feature Engineering:** Create new features or modify existing ones to enhance model performance (e.g., deriving features from timestamps, combining related features).
* **Encoding Categorical Variables:** Convert categorical features into numerical representations using techniques like one-hot encoding, label encoding, or target encoding.

### 3. Data Splitting

* **Train-Validation Split:** Split the `train.csv` data into training and validation sets (e.g., 70-30 or 80-20) for hyperparameter tuning and model evaluation.
* **Stratification:** Utilize stratified sampling to ensure similar class distributions across training and validation sets, especially given potential target variable imbalance.

### 4. Model Selection and Training

* **Baseline Model:** Start with a simple model (e.g., Logistic Regression, Decision Tree) to establish a performance benchmark.
* **Advanced Models:** Experiment with more sophisticated models like Random Forests, Gradient Boosting Machines (XGBoost, LightGBM), and potentially Neural Networks. Tune each model using techniques like grid search or random search.
* **Cross-Validation:** Implement k-fold cross-validation to ensure consistent model performance and reduce overfitting risk.

### 5. Model Evaluation and Tuning

* **Performance Metrics:** Evaluate the model on the validation set using **Macro-F1 score, Precision, and Recall**, analyzing performance across TP, BP, and FP classes for balanced results.
* **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Fine-tune hyperparameters to optimize model performance, adjusting learning rates, regularization parameters, tree depths, etc.
* **Handling Class Imbalance:** Apply techniques like SMOTE, adjusting class weights, or using ensemble methods if class imbalance is significant.

### 6. Model Interpretation

* **Feature Importance:** Analyze which features contribute most to predictions using methods like SHAP values, permutation importance, or model-specific measures.
* **Error Analysis:** Identify common misclassifications to gain insights for further improvements in feature engineering or model refinement.

### 7. Final Evaluation on Test Set

* **Testing:** Evaluate the finalized and optimized model on the `test.csv` dataset. Report the final **Macro-F1 score, Precision, and Recall**.
* **Comparison to Baseline:** Compare performance on the test set to the baseline and initial validation results to ensure consistency and improvement.

### 8. Documentation and Reporting

* **Model Documentation:** Thoroughly document the entire process, including rationale for chosen methods, challenges, solutions, key findings, and model performance.
* **Recommendations:** Provide recommendations for integrating the model into SOC workflows, future improvements, and deployment considerations.

## Project Evaluation Metrics

The success and effectiveness of this project will be primarily evaluated based on the following metrics:

* **Macro-F1 Score:** A balanced metric that considers performance across all classes (TP, BP, FP) equally, crucial for multi-class imbalanced datasets.
* **Precision:** Measures the accuracy of positive predictions, minimizing false positives (e.g., incorrectly flagging a benign incident as a true threat).
* **Recall:** Measures the model's ability to correctly identify all relevant instances (true positives), ensuring that actual threats are not missed.
